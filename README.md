## PracticeGerman

PracticeGerman is a web app that helps you improve your German language skills.

Unlike other language apps with fixed course content, we believe language learning should have no limits. Thatâ€™s why we use state-of-the-art AI models to teach you German at  your own level and pace.

We noticed that many learners finish structured courses but still struggle to communicate outside the textbook. **PracticeGerman** is built to complement your course and focus on what matters most:  *practice* .

ðŸ’¡ Inspired by a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg9sF6JC5lk), we recommend using the app to  **describe your daily routine in German every evening** . Just write as much as you can, even if youâ€™re unsure. The app will give you corrections, feedback, and native German alternatives.
